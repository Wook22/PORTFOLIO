# PORTFOLIO

### Introduction
In this README file, I will explain how I created my personal website, which can be found at https://wook22.github.io/PORTFOLIO/. The purpose of this document is to help others understand the technologies and tools I used to build my site, as well as provide a brief overview of the design choices I made.

### Technologies Used
To create my website, I used a variety of technologies, including:

* HTML: to create the basic structure and content of the website.
* CSS: to style the website and make it visually appealing.
* JavaScript: to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website.
* Bootstrap: to provide a responsive layout and pre-built UI components.
* GitHub Pages: to host my website for free on GitHub's servers.

### Design Choices
When designing my website, I wanted it to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate. I chose a minimalist color scheme of white, gray, and black, with occasional pops of color for emphasis. I also made sure to use plenty of whitespace to give the site a spacious and open feel.

To make my site easy to navigate, I included a sticky navigation bar at the top of the page that stays in place as the user scrolls. The navigation bar includes links to various sections of the site, as well as social media icons for easy access to my profiles.

### Conclusion
Overall, I am very happy with how my personal website turned out. By using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and GitHub Pages, I was able to create a clean, professional-looking site that showcases my work and skills. I hope this README file has been helpful in explaining how I made my site, and I encourage others to use these tools and techniques to create their own personal websites.
